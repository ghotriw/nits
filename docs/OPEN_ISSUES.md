# Open Issues

Problems that still need data or a real-world check. Fixed issues live on in the code, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`AGENTS.md` and git history; remove an entry here once it is resolved.

## Root cause of the hardware VP9 decoder stall

**Observed once** (October 2026) playing a 1080p50 VP9 MP4 with hardware decoding (supplemental decoder), after
heavy UI activity and a `sample` of the process. The feeder was blocked in `VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame →
RemoteVideoDecoder_DecodeFrameWithOptions → FigSemaphoreWaitRelative` while the session's `VTDecoderXPCService`
sat idle (0 % CPU): waiting for something, not decoding. `vmmap` showed no IOSurface build-up in Nits.

The stall itself is now recovered from (see "Stalls and buffering" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`); the cause is
unknown. Hypotheses: output-buffer pool exhaustion (surfaces held by the display layer / a busy WindowServer), the
process suspension by `sample` disturbing the XPC exchange, or a VideoToolbox bug in the VP9 supplemental decoder.

**If it recurs:** the `Video decoder stalled: …` log line records the display layer's status and
`requiresFlushToResumeDecoding`, the session's frames in flight, the frame queue fill, frame and clock positions
and the playing / seeking / stepping state. The decoder is replaced within 3 s, so run
`sample VTDecoderXPCService` as soon as video freezes.

## `fontd` not answering libass' font requests

**Observed three times** (October 2026, macOS 27) in full test runs, never in the app: every libass thread of the
test process waited in `match_fonts → CopyMatchingFontDescriptors → XTCopyPropertiesForFontsMatchingRequest →
xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply_sync`, `fontd` at 0 % CPU; once 12 threads at once, the whole cooperative
pool, so the run hung. Killing the test process (or `fontd`) cleared it. A probe of 12 threads in 4 processes asking
Core Text for 20 000 unknown families didn't reproduce it. Hypothesis, unchecked: requests that reach `fontd` just
as launchd starts it (in the first hang its PID followed the test process's).

Since then libass calls run one at a time on their own queue, the engine shows the text cues for the rest of the
media once one is stuck (see "libass" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`), and tests reach libass through `LibassRenderer`,
which fails a test after 20 s instead of holding a thread of the run.

**If it recurs:** the `libass has been stuck in a call for …` log line; `sample` the process and check whether `fontd`
was started at about the same time (`ps -o lstart -p $(pgrep fontd)`).

## Buffering needs a real-world check

`PlayerEngine+Buffering` (holding the clock while media runs out) is covered only by tests that stop the
feeders. To check in the app:
- a network stream on a throttled connection (e.g. Network Link Conditioner) and a file on a slow share: the
  `Buffering at …` / `Buffering ended after …` log lines should bracket each stall, and playback should resume
  where it stopped;
- a video decoder too slow for realtime (e.g. software 8K AV1), which starves audio through the demuxer's
  read-ahead limit: expected to alternate between buffering and playing rather than drift;
- possible side effect: an audio track that ends before the video, with under 20 frames queued (decoder
  barely keeping up), would alternate between buffering and playing.

The UI does not show `isBuffering` yet.

## A 200 ms frame hold on the display link

**Observed once** (October 2026, 25p Dolby Vision over HTTP from Emby, LG UltraFine at 60 Hz, audio on AirPods): one
frame stayed up 12 ticks (200 ms) and the next four frames never showed
(`held 12×1`, `skipped 4`), with no buffering, network or drop messages; it followed a `−8.6 ms` clock jump. A
negative jump of that kind is what a tick blocked between reading the synchronizer clock and `CACurrentMediaTime()`
produces, so the display-link thread may have been blocked. Not seen in 6 minutes of later runs. The AirPods also
step the clock early in playback (see "Display pacing" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`), so the audio device may matter:
note it when this recurs.

**If it recurs:** the `Frame held …` line (see `docs/LOGGING.md`) tells a link that stopped calling, a tick blocked
on our side (`max tick`, `max clock read`) and an empty frame queue apart.

## Flaky tests to watch

- **`BackwardFrameSteppingTests`** failed once locally with `engine.frameStep.cache.count → 0` after a paused
  exact seek. Suspected: the pause did not hold (the seek ran as a resuming seek, which does not seed the cache) or
  feeding restarted after it (`startFeeding()` clears the cache). The failure message reports cache size, play
  state and current frame to tell these apart.
- **`FormatDescriptionCacheTests`** failed twice on CI with VideoToolbox returning 1–3 frames of 30 (always 30
  locally). The failure message now reports fed samples, session creation status, decode error statuses and the
  last callback status.
