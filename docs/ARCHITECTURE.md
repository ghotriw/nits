# Nits Architecture

Background and rationale behind the rules in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). `AGENTS.md` holds the
short, enforceable invariants; this document explains how the pieces fit together and why.

## Mission

Reference-grade playback of HDR and Dolby Vision (Profile 8.1 / HDR10) video on macOS:

- **SDR displays** (external 4K/5K monitors, EDR == 1.0): a custom Metal tone-mapper (ITU-R
  BT.2390 EETF, 203-nit reference white, Display P3, Gamma 2.2, FidelityFX CAS) instead of the
  washed-out / crushed look of default OS tone mapping.
- **XDR / EDR displays** (EDR > 1.01): decoded frames go straight to `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`
  to use the panel's full 1000–1600 nit peak.

## Layers

```
[Presentation UI (NitsUI)]            observes PlayerEngine via @Observable, dispatches actions
              ↓
[Windowing & integration (NitsKit)]   windows, menus, NowPlaying
              ↓
[Engine core (NitsCore)]              PlayerEngineProtocol + PlayerEngine (@Observable, @MainActor)
              ↓
[Pipelines]                           demuxer, decoders, FrameQueue, Metal renderer, synchronizer
```

- **NitsCore** — demuxing, decoding, master clock, Metal rendering, frame queues, EDR/screen
  handover, playback history. No SwiftUI. `PlayerEngine` is `@Observable` directly, so there is no
  intermediate view-model; views re-evaluate only on the properties they read. Exports the
  `NativeVideoHostView` canvas.
- **NitsKit** — `@MainActor` window lifecycle (`PlayerWindowController`, `PlayerWindow`), menu
  commands (`PlayerCommands`), system media integration (`NowPlayingController`).
- **NitsUI** — declarative views (`ContentView`, `ControlsOverlay`, `TimelineSlider`,
  `SettingsView`, `PerformanceHUDView`, `SubtitleOverlayView`). Transient UI state (fullscreen
  transitions, auto-hide) lives in `PlayerUIState`.

### Embedding (WKWebView / headless hosts)

The engine is designed to be embedded in hosts with web-driven UIs (e.g. an Emby client):

- `NativeVideoHostView` is a bare video canvas; a transparent `WKWebView` can sit on top.
- Commands in / events out go through `PlayerEngineProtocol`
  (`Sources/NitsCore/Protocols/PlayerEngineProtocol.swift`); the event callbacks
  (`onTimeUpdate`, `onPlaybackStateChanged`) are shaped for JSON bridging to
  `window.webkit.messageHandlers`.
- The demuxer accepts HTTP/HTTPS/HLS URLs with custom headers (`X-Emby-Token`, `Authorization`,
  User-Agent, cookies) passed as FFmpeg `AVDictionary` options.

## Video pipeline

### Decode → queue → present

Packets from `MediaDemuxer` are decoded by a `VideoDecoderProtocol` implementation chosen by
`VideoDecoderFactory`: `VTVideoDecoder` (hardware; AV1/VP9 are probed first because virtualised
CI runners advertise VT support without the decoder block) or `FFmpegVideoDecoder` (software
fallback). Decoded `CVPixelBuffer`s land in `FrameQueue`, and a `CADisplayLink` tick picks the
frame matching `synchronizer.currentTime()` and presents it in one of two modes:

- **`.metalToneMap`** — `MetalVideoRenderer` draws into `CAMetalLayer` with the BT.2390 curve.
- **`.system`** — the buffer is wrapped in a `CMSampleBuffer` with
  `kCMSampleAttachmentKey_DisplayImmediately = true` and enqueued to `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`.

Default mode is `.auto`, re-evaluated on display changes via
`screen.maximumExtendedDynamicRangeColorComponentValue > 1.01`. Because frames are decoded
continuously regardless of mode, switching modes only toggles `isMetalLayerVisible` and flushes the
display layer — no stall.

### Why the display layer is isolated from the synchronizer

On Apple Silicon, a fullscreen `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` on an XDR panel is promoted to IOMFB
Direct Scanout. Two things deadlock `WindowServer` on a hardware fence (`IOFenceTransaction`),
freezing input across all windows for up to ~30 s:

1. **Compressed passthrough** — enqueuing raw HEVC/H.264 NALUs with movie PTS, then seeking
   backwards, sends older PTS values that break the fence.
2. **Synchronizer attachment** — if the layer is attached to `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer`,
   `setRate(0.0)` on pause blocks the fence until the rate goes back to 1.

Hence: only decoded buffers reach the layer; the layer's `controlTimebase` is an independent
host-clock timebase (`CMTimebaseCreateWithSourceClock(..., CMClockGetHostTimeClock(), ...)`, rate
1.0, never paused); pausing simply stops enqueuing; the synchronizer drives audio only.

Apple deprecated `enqueue(_:)` / `flush()` on the renderer in favour of
`synchronizer.sampleBufferReceiver`, which would require the attachment above. `PlayerEngine`
therefore calls `enqueueSampleBuffer:` / `flush` through cached selectors, with the
`enqueueSampleBuffer:` IMP resolved once at init for the display-link hot path. This is purely
to avoid the deprecation warning — the runtime behaviour is identical to `enqueue(_:)`.

### Seeking

Seeks run on the serial `seekQueue` and carry a generation token (`currentSeekId`); stale seeks are
dropped, so rapid scrubbing never runs concurrent demuxer seeks. A seek clears `FrameQueue`,
flushes the decoder and the renderer, but keeps the `VTDecompressionSession` alive. Before any
session invalidate/reset, `VTVideoDecoder` waits for in-flight frames
(`VTDecompressionSessionWaitForAsynchronousFrames`) so output callbacks can't race the replacement.

### FrameQueue

A fixed-capacity, pre-allocated ring buffer of `DecodedFrame?`:

- Pop advances `head` in O(1) and immediately nils the vacated slot — each `CVPixelBuffer` pins an
  `IOSurface` from the decoder's pool, and holding it for a full rotation starves
  `VTDecompressionSession`.
- Frames with non-decreasing PTS append at `tail` in O(1); out-of-order B-frames are placed by
  binary search, shifting only the few affected slots.
- `lastRenderedBuffer` keeps the frame on screen so mode switches and scrubbing while paused can
  re-render it (`renderCurrentFrame()`).

### Backpressure

- **Video** — the feeding task stops decoding once `FrameQueue` holds 40 frames and resumes below
  25, polling with `Task.sleep` (no thread blocking).
- **Audio** — buffers go through `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer.Receiver.enqueue`, whose `await`
  provides backpressure from CoreAudio.

### Display pacing

`CADisplayLink` from `view.displayLink(target:selector:)` / `screen.displayLink(...)`. Unlike
`CVDisplayLink`, it follows the window across screens, tracks ProMotion/VRR, and needs no
`Unmanaged` C callbacks. Lifecycle: `isPaused` / `invalidate()`.

Every tick presents a frame (`DisplayImmediately` / Metal draw), so the tick rate is the presentation
cadence. The link only delivers rates that divide the screen's maximum refresh (120 Hz ProMotion:
120/60/40/30/24), so `preferredDisplayLinkRate` picks the lowest such rate ≥ 48 Hz that is a whole multiple
of the content fps (29.97 → 60, 24 on 144 Hz → 48) and otherwise the screen maximum, whose finer ticks keep
the unavoidable cadence error smallest (25 / 50 fps on 120 Hz; 23.976 counts as 24 within a 1% tolerance).
A fixed 60 Hz request would give 24p film 3:2 pulldown judder; a fixed 120 Hz one wastes ProMotion power on 30/60 fps content.

Frames are chosen for the clock at the vsync they will appear on — `synchronizer.currentTime()` projected to
`link.targetTimestamp` — because the callback runs on the main run loop and its latency jitters by
milliseconds; sampling the clock there skips frames whenever content fps is close to the link rate.

## Metal tone-mapper (`HDRToneMapping.metal`)

- **Input** — biplanar YCbCr: `r16Unorm` luma + `rg16Unorm` chroma for 10-bit (VideoToolbox
  MSB-aligns P010, so range limits are expressed on the 16-bit scale, e.g. `4096/65535`,
  `56064/65535`), and an 8-bit path. Full/video range comes from the format description.
- **Pipeline** — PQ (ST 2084) inverse EOTF → linear nits → BT.2390 EETF compressed to
  `targetNits = 203` → BT.2020 → Display P3 (D65) with gamut clamping → pure Gamma 2.2
  (`pow(max(c, 0), 1/2.2)`).
- **Sharpening** — AMD FidelityFX CAS: `peak = -1 / mix(8, 5, strength); weight = amplitude * peak`,
  which stays finite at `strength = 1`.
- **Output** — `.bgr10a2Unorm` in Display P3; 8-bit output bands visibly in skies and shadows.
- Source peak (MaxCLL / mastering luminance from side data or SEI) feeds
  `uniforms.sourcePeakNits`.

## Audio

A single `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` is the master clock; `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` is
attached to it. `FFAudioDecoder` resamples via `swr_convert` using `extended_data` (`data` only has
8 plane pointers) and re-creates its `SwrContext` whenever sample format, rate or channel layout
changes mid-stream (e.g. 5.1 → stereo after a track switch).
